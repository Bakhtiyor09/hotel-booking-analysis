# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

## 📌Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover trends in bookings, revenue, cancellations, and hotel type performance.
An interactive Tableau dashboard was built to support data-driven decision-making for hotel management.

The analysis focuses on time-based trends, seasonality, and comparative performance between City Hotels and Resort Hotels.

## 🎯Business Objectives
- Analyze monthly booking trends
- Evaluate revenue performance over time
- Identify cancellation patterns
- Compare performance by hotel type
- Provide actionable business insights and recommendations

## 📊 Dashboard Components
- Monthly Bookings Trend
- Monthly Revenue Trend
- Monthly Cancellations Trend
- Revenue by Hotel Type
- Seasonality Analysis (Best & Worst Months)
- Key Insights & Recommendations
- Interactive date and hotel filters

## Dataset
- Hotel booking dataset (CSV)
- Includes hotel type, lead time, booking status, and customer details

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Tableau Desktop
- Tableau Public
- Excel / CSV data
- Data visualization & exploratory analysis techniques

## Key Questions
- What factors affect booking cancellations?
- Which months have the highest number of bookings?
- How does lead time impact cancellations?

## Results
- Bookings and revenue show strong seasonality, with peak performance during mid-year months and weaker demand in off-season periods.

- City Hotels generate higher total revenue than Resort Hotels, indicating stronger and more consistent year-round demand.

- Cancellation volumes increase during peak demand periods, suggesting the influence of flexible cancellation policies and demand uncertainty.

- Cancellation rates rise significantly with longer lead times, showing that bookings made far in advance carry higher cancellation risk.

- Revenue trends closely follow booking volumes, confirming that overall performance is primarily demand-driven rather than price-driven.

## Next Steps
- Build a Power BI dashboard
- Add predictive modeling
